Basic js
========== 

javaScript code is typically interpreted regardless of whether 
it's used on the frontend or backend.

In frontend development, JavaScript code is interpreted by the user's
web browser. The browser reads and executes the JavaScript code directly,
 interpreting it on the fly.

As a software engineer hmko km se km variable use krne a 

who is the best software engineer ?

jitna km  ram use krogo jitna km cpu use krogo appka system , cpu ,server free
rhega


Prescedence of operator
